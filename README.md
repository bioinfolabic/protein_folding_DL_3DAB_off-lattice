# A Novel Approach to Protein Folding Prediction based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks: A Preliminary Investigation and Analysis

The protein folding dataset was created in order to train and evaluate our protein folding predictor. This was accomplished by using the Molecular Dynamics (MD) method, which was proposed in a previous work Benitez (2012).

For simulating the folding pathways, we used a synthetic protein sequence based on the Fibonacci 
numbers that was proposed by Stillinger (1995). The AB sequence is AB^2AB^2(AB)^2BAB, where A and B represent the hydrophobic 
and hydrophilic amino acids, respectively. 

The dataset is composed of 20 different folding pathways, which start from different initial folding states 
(i.e. protein structures along the folding process, as shown in Figure 1, where each pathway is composed of 101 equally spaced in time folding states.

A new method for analyzing the folding pathways is proposed in this study. 
This method is based on bi-dimensional Heatmap visualization, where the average 
RMSD measure of the $i$th folding state of all pathways is represented as colors.
Larger values and lower values are represented by warm and cold colors, 
where warm colors represent highly different initial folding states (i.e. unfolded states).
On the other hand, blue indicates equal structures (i.e. native state).

Figures 2 and 3 present the similarity between initial and final folding states of all pathways, respectively. 
It is possible to observe that the protein structures are more diverse at the beginning %of the folding process 
as well as the structures tend to be more similar during the final stages of the folding mechanism, according to the behavior of the in vivo protein folding process and the Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis. Here, it is important to recall that the energy landscape is characterized by several intermediate folding states and energy barriers between the two significantly folded states, the denatured and the native states. Thus, it is possible to conclude that the pathways generated by the MD approach do not reach the native state, where the entire heatmap of the final pathways (Figure 3) must be blue. Finally, considering that the MD is deterministic, we can conclude that the 20 pathways are different and suitable for training and testing the Deep Learning approaches.

Based on such protein folding data, we created a tuple of folds to generate our dataset, where, the first i-th fold and another j-th fold are the t (input) and t+1 (target) time steps, end up with 100 pairs of folds per pathway. Next, the tuples of folds are split in train and test subsets using a Hold-out validation (70% to train and 30% to test). Seven and three folds at each 10 subsequent tuples were randomly selected for training and testing the LSTM network, respectively. It is important to recall that in order to ensure that the test subset has a representative data of the whole protein folding mechanism, a homogeneous amount of tuples of folds was selected from the pathways.
